- *Domain* :: Personal book tracker -- Firefox new tab browser extension
- *Researched* :: [2026-02-25 Tue]
- *Confidence* :: MEDIUM-HIGH (direct observation of Goodreads, Hardcover,
  Literal.club, Oku; StoryGraph returned 403)

* Context: new tab constraint

This is *not a web app*. It is a new tab page replacement. Every design
decision must be filtered through this lens:

- *Screen real estate is shared* -- the new tab is seen for ~2 seconds before
  navigating away; it must communicate value instantly
- *No navigation chrome* -- cannot rely on sidebars, multi-page flows, complex
  menus
- *Interactions must be fast* -- the user is /on their way somewhere else/;
  heavy modals and multi-step flows hurt
- *The value is ambient* -- seeing your current read is the primary
  interaction, not actively managing a library
- *Local storage limits apply* -- ~browser.storage.local~ has a 10MB quota by
  default; cover images must be URLs, not base64

* Feature landscape

** Table stakes (users expect these)

Features that must exist or the tool feels broken. Standard across all book
trackers.

#+CAPTION: Table stakes features
| Feature                          | Why Expected                              | Complexity | Notes                                  |
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+------------+----------------------------------------|
| Book status (Want/Reading/Read)  | Core primitive of all book trackers       | LOW        | All major apps use this exact model    |
| Add book via search              | Users expect title → results, not ISBNs  | MEDIUM     | Open Library: free, no API key         |
| Manual book entry fallback       | Search won't find obscure/ARC/foreign     | LOW        | Simple form: title, author, cover URL  |
| Display current read prominently | BookTab's entire value prop               | LOW        | The hero element; dominant visual      |
| Reading queue / to-read list     | Users expect a manageable backlog         | LOW        | Simple ordered list for v1             |
| Notes while reading              | Standard in Goodreads, StoryGraph, Literal | MEDIUM    | Per-book plain textarea is fine        |
| Rating after finishing           | 5-star on completed books                 | LOW        | Optional field on mark-as-read         |
| Review / reflection              | Post-finish reflection, distinct from notes | LOW      | Two distinct fields per book           |
| View finished books history      | Users need to see what they've read       | LOW        | Sort by date finished                  |
| Data export (JSON)               | Users expect to own their data            | LOW        | Full library as downloadable file      |
| Data import (JSON)               | Backup/restore; required for safety       | LOW        | Parse, validate, merge or replace      |

** Differentiators (competitive advantage)

Features not standard across all competitors, or that take new meaning in
the new-tab context.

#+CAPTION: Differentiating features
| Feature                            | Value Proposition                                  | Complexity | Notes                                    |
|------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------|
| Current book as new tab hero       | No competitor does this -- unique ambient pattern  | LOW        | Differentiator is the /context/, not the feature |
| Tags on to-read books              | Custom free-form tags; most personal trackers lack | LOW        | e.g. "gift", "non-fiction", "need-to-buy" |
| Priority ordering of to-read queue | Goodreads unordered; no major app has queue priority | MEDIUM   | Drag-to-reorder or up/down arrows        |
| "Why I want to read this" notes    | No major app has a dedicated intention field       | LOW        | Single text field; surfaces motivation   |
| Clean, minimal new tab aesthetic   | Major apps are dense discovery UIs                 | LOW        | Architectural commitment, not a feature  |
| No account required                | Every major competitor requires signup             | LOW        | Baked in by architecture                 |

** Anti-features (do not build)

#+CAPTION: Anti-features to deliberately avoid
| Feature                    | Why Requested                          | Why Problematic                                   | Alternative                      |
|----------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Page/% progress tracking   | Granular progress ("page 234 of 412")  | Encourages interaction every tab-open; out of scope | Status-only: Reading means in it |
| Reading stats / analytics  | Books/year, genres, avg rating         | Dashboard complexity; stats need dedicated sessions | Basic history count              |
| Social features            | Goodreads muscle memory                | Requires auth, backend, network effects             | JSON export for sharing          |
| Book recommendations       | Goodreads/Hardcover have them          | Requires ML, external data; shifts product type     | Tags + queue for user curation   |
| Cloud sync / cross-device  | Library on phone + desktop             | Backend, auth, conflict resolution; out of scope    | JSON export/import               |
| Reading challenges / goals | Goodreads annual challenge is popular  | Motivational mechanics compete with calm ambient UI | History count serves this passively |
| ISBN barcode scanner       | Literal.club, Hardcover have this      | Camera API not available in new tab context         | Manual entry + search            |
| Rich text notes            | Notion/Bear users expect formatting    | TipTap/Quill adds bundle size; overkill here        | Plain textarea; Markdown later   |
| Multiple current books     | Power readers juggle 3--5 books        | Dilutes focus of the UI hero                        | One primary book; others paused  |
| Browser popup / toolbar    | "Quick add" without opening new tab    | Second UI surface to maintain; out of scope         | New tab is the expected pattern  |

Dependency notes:
- *Book Storage Schema must be designed first* -- every feature depends on it;
  lock it in Phase 1
- *Export schema must stabilize before v1* -- once users export and backup
  data, breaking schema changes require migration tooling
- *Status: "Read" requires a =date_finished= field* stored automatically when
  status changes -- history timeline depends on this

* MVP definition

** Launch with (v1)

Minimum viable product -- validates the core loop: see current book → manage
queue → take notes → finish → see history.

- [ ] New tab override -- Firefox new tab shows BookTab UI
- [ ] Manual book entry with optional cover URL
- [ ] Status tracking: Want to Read / Reading / Read
- [ ] Current book displayed as hero on new tab -- cover, title, author
- [ ] To-read queue -- list of Want to Read books
- [ ] JSON export -- full data dump as downloadable file
- [ ] JSON import -- restore from JSON backup

** Add after validation (v1.x)

- [ ] Book search via Open Library API with auto-fill
- [ ] Reading notes -- per-book notes field during Reading status
- [ ] Review + star rating -- per-book, unlocked when marked Read
- [ ] Finished books history -- chronological list with finish date
- [ ] Tags on books -- free-form tags with filtering
- [ ] "Why I want to read this" field -- intention capture on queue add
- [ ] Queue manual reorder -- drag or up/down priority

** Future consideration (v2+)

- Cover image caching -- storage budget management required
- Multiple reading statuses (Paused, DNF) -- wait for real user demand
- Markdown rendering in notes -- low-cost later, defer to avoid v1 scope creep
- "Next up" display on new tab -- complicates hero layout

*Competitive whitespace:* The combination of (1) no account required,
(2) new tab ambient visibility, and (3) offline-first local storage is
completely unoccupied. All major competitors are social discovery platforms.
