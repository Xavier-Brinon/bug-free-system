* What This Is

A Firefox browser extension that replaces the new tab page with a personal
book tracker. Designed for a single user who wants to see their current read
front and center every time they open a new tab, while also managing a
tagged, prioritized reading queue and capturing notes and reflections on
books.

* Core Value

Every new tab is a reminder of what you're reading and what's next —
keeping your reading life visible without leaving the browser.

* Requirements

** Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

** Active

- [ ] New tab page replaces Firefox's default with book tracker UI
- [ ] Current book is displayed prominently on the new tab page
- [ ] User can set a book's status: Want to Read / Reading / Read
- [ ] User can add books via search (metadata auto-filled) or manual entry
- [ ] User can tag books and prioritize the to-read queue
- [ ] User can take notes while reading and write a review after finishing
- [ ] User can record why they want to read a book (queue notes)
- [ ] User can view a basic history (timeline of finished books)
- [ ] User can export all data as a JSON file
- [ ] User can import data from a JSON file
- [ ] All data is stored locally in browser storage (no backend, works offline)

** Out of Scope

- Multi-user / accounts -- personal tool only
- Cloud sync or cross-device sync -- local browser storage only
- Page/percentage progress tracking -- status-only tracking
- Reading stats or analytics -- basic history only
- Firefox popup or context menu -- new tab page only
- Mobile or desktop app -- web extension only

* Context

- Delivered as a Firefox browser extension (WebExtension API)
- Data lives in ~browser.storage.local~ -- no server, no auth, works offline
- Book metadata sourced via search API (e.g. Open Library) with manual entry
  as fallback
- Import/export as JSON for portability and backup
- UI should be clean and minimal -- content-focused, no clutter
- All documentation written in org-mode; ADRs in =docs/decisions/=

* Constraints

- *Platform* :: Firefox extension only -- WebExtension manifest v3
- *Storage* :: ~browser.storage.local~ only -- no backend, no external accounts
- *UI* :: Clean and minimal -- no heavy frameworks if avoidable
- *Data portability* :: JSON import/export must preserve all book data and notes
- *Documentation* :: Org-mode format throughout; MADR 4.0 structure for ADRs
- *Testing* :: Vitest, TDD red-green-refactor vertical slicing
- *State* :: XState v5 machines/actors for all stateful logic

* Key Decisions

|---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
| Firefox extension (new tab)           | User wants it as their default new tab page            | — Pending |
| Browser-local storage only            | No backend complexity, offline, data stays private     | — Pending |
| JSON for import/export                | Structured, re-importable, human-inspectable           | — Pending |
| Status-only progress tracking         | Simpler UX, page-level granularity not needed          | — Pending |
| XState v5 for all stateful logic      | Explicit state machines, predictable, testable         | — Pending |
| Vitest as test framework              | Native ESM, same config as Vite, fast                  | — Pending |
| TDD red-green-refactor vertical slice | Honest tests, prevents bulk test writing               | — Pending |
| Org-mode for all documentation        | Primary editor is Emacs; org-mode is native format     | — Pending |
| MADR ADRs in org-mode format          | MADR structure preserved; =.org= files in =docs/decisions/= | — Pending |
