- *Defined* :: [2026-02-25 Tue]
- *Core Value* :: Every new tab is a reminder of what you're reading and
  what's next — keeping your reading life visible without leaving the browser.

* v1 Requirements

** Extension Core

- [ ] *CORE-01*: Extension replaces Firefox new tab page via
  =chrome_url_overrides.newtab=
- [ ] *CORE-02*: All scripts are CSP-safe (no inline JS, no CDN scripts,
  all bundled)
- [ ] *CORE-03*: Data schema includes =schemaVersion= field from day one
- [ ] *CORE-04*: All app state and async flows managed via XState v5
  machines/actors

** Library

- [ ] *LIB-01*: User can add a book manually (title, author, optional cover URL)
- [ ] *LIB-02*: User can set a book's status: Want to Read / Reading / Read
- [ ] *LIB-03*: User can edit a book's details after adding
- [ ] *LIB-04*: User can delete a book from the library

** New Tab Display

- [ ] *DISP-01*: Current book (Reading status) is shown prominently on the
  new tab page
- [ ] *DISP-02*: Empty state shown with a prompt when no book is set to
  Reading
- [ ] *DISP-03*: To-read count is visible on the new tab page

** Queue

- [ ] *QUEUE-01*: User can view all Want to Read books in a list
- [ ] *QUEUE-02*: User can add a note to a queued book explaining why they
  want to read it

** Data Safety

- [ ] *DATA-01*: User can export all library data as a JSON file
- [ ] *DATA-02*: User can import library data from a JSON file
- [ ] *DATA-03*: A backup export is auto-created before any import overwrites
  existing data

** Architecture Documentation

- [ ] *ADR-01*: =docs/decisions/= initialized with MADR 4.0 template (org-mode
  format)
- [ ] *ADR-02*: ADR written before implementing every architecturally
  significant decision
- [ ] *ADR-03*: Each phase plan includes at least one ADR task

** Developer Practice

- [ ] *DEV-01*: Vitest configured as the test framework
- [ ] *DEV-02*: All features implemented via red-green-refactor vertical
  slicing (one test → one implementation → repeat)
- [ ] *DEV-03*: No tests written in bulk after implementation
- [ ] *DEV-04*: Tests exercise public interfaces only -- no internal mocking,
  no testing implementation details
- [ ] *DEV-05*: Each phase begins with a mandatory tidy-up step before any
  new feature code
- [ ] *DEV-06*: ADRs written for test framework and TDD methodology choices
  before Phase 1 execution

* v2 Requirements

** Book Search

- *SRCH-01*: User can search for a book by title or author via Open Library API
- *SRCH-02*: Search results auto-fill book metadata (cover, author, description)

- *QUEUE-04*: User can reorder/prioritize the to-read queue

** History

- *HIST-01*: User can view a chronological timeline of finished books with
  finish dates

* Out of Scope

#+CAPTION: Features explicitly excluded from scope
| Feature                          | Reason                                                 |
|----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-user / accounts            | Personal tool -- single user by design                 |
| Cloud sync / cross-device        | Local browser storage only -- no backend               |
| Page/percentage progress         | Status-only is sufficient; pages add complexity        |
| Reading stats / analytics        | Basic history only; stats are a different product      |
| Firefox popup or context menu    | New tab page is the entire surface                     |
| Mobile or desktop app            | Browser extension only                                 |
| Barcode scanning                 | Camera API not available in new tab extension context  |
| Social features (friends, share) | Deliberately out of scope -- not a social platform     |
