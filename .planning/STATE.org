* Accumulated Context

** Architectural decisions (pre-ADR)

- *Storage* :: ~browser.storage.local~ only -- never =window.localStorage=
  (wiped on privacy clear)
- *Manifest* :: V3 (Firefox 109+) -- no service workers; event pages are fine
- *UI layer* :: React 19 -- chosen over Vanilla TS because UI complexity spans
  4--6 views, stateful forms, and XState/TanStack Query integration; ADR-0003
  written in Phase 1 before scaffold begins
- *Async storage* :: TanStack Query wraps ~browser.storage.local~ -- provides
  loading/error/success states and cache invalidation via
  ~browser.storage.onChanged~; ADR-0004 written in Phase 1
- *State management* :: XState v5 machines/actors for ALL stateful logic;
  ~@xstate/react~ (~useMachine~, ~useSelector~) bridges to React; ADR-0007
  written in Phase 2 before any machine code
- *No background script* :: architecture is single privileged page (new tab)
  with direct storage access
- *Book metadata API* :: Open Library only -- no API key = no key exposure in
  extension source; ADR-0009 written in Phase 3 before search is implemented
- *Data structure* :: =booktab_data= key →
  ~{ schemaVersion, books: Record<id, BookRecord>, settings }~
- *Component isolation* :: Storybook (Vite builder, React framework) --
  ADR-0005 written in Phase 1; installation in Phase 2 when first component exists
- *E2E testing* :: Playwright / Chromium only -- Playwright cannot load
  extensions in its Firefox build; ADR-0006 written in Phase 2 before E2E scaffold
- *Documentation* :: All docs in org-mode; ADRs follow MADR 4.0 structure in
  =docs/decisions/= as =.org= files

** Critical pitfalls (pre-empt in Phase 2)

1. *CSP blocks inline JS / CDN scripts* -- all handlers via
   ~addEventListener()~, all JS in =.js= files
2. =window.localStorage= *wiped on privacy clear* -- use
   ~browser.storage.local~ exclusively
3. *Async race on new tab open* -- show loading state until
   ~storage.get()~ resolves; TanStack Query handles loading/error/success
   states; gate writes behind =storageReady=
4. *Flat unversioned export schema* -- =schemaVersion: 1= in schema from
   day one; migration layer before any schema change ships
5. *Open Library rate limits* -- 400--600ms debounce, =User-Agent= header,
   both =openlibrary.org= + =covers.openlibrary.org= in =host_permissions=
6. *Destructive import without warning* -- auto-backup before import;
   confirmation dialog; schema validation before write
7. *Playwright + Firefox* -- Playwright cannot load extensions in its Firefox
   build; E2E smoke tests run in Chromium proxy via
   ~chromium.launchPersistentContext()~; manual Firefox acceptance testing
   required

** File format conventions

All project documentation is written in org-mode format (=.org= files).

*Exception -- GSD workflow artefacts:* The =.planning/phases/= directory
contains files ending in =-PLAN.md= and =-SUMMARY.md=. These use the ~.md~
extension because the GSD tooling (=gsd-tools.cjs=) hardcodes
~endsWith('-PLAN.md')~ and ~endsWith('-SUMMARY.md')~ when scanning for plans
and summaries. Renaming them to =.org= would break plan discovery, wave
execution, and progress tracking.

These files are GSD tooling artefacts, not project documentation. Their
content uses YAML frontmatter + XML task blocks (the GSD format). Do not
convert them to org-mode.

All other files -- =REQUIREMENTS.org=, =ROADMAP.org=, =STATE.org=,
=PROJECT.org=, =docs/decisions/*.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org= -- are org-mode.

** Developer practice rules (locked in Phase 1)

- Every phase begins with a tidy-up step (refactoring/cleanup before new
  feature code)
- *ADR before implementation, at any phase* -- an ADR is written immediately
  before implementing any architecturally significant decision, at whatever
  phase that decision arises. If a decision is later revised, a new ADR
  is written that supersedes the previous one (old ADR status set to
  "Superseded by NNNN"). The history is never rewritten -- only extended.
  This creates a complete, honest decision log for learning purposes.
- TDD: red-green-refactor vertical slicing -- one test → one implementation
  → repeat
- No tests written in bulk after implementation
- Tests exercise public interfaces only -- no internal mocking, no
  implementation detail testing
- All ADRs include Mermaid diagrams (ob-mermaid syntax, =:file= header
  required) when the decision involves a flow, state transition, dependency
  graph, or data structure

** Open questions

- [ ] Does =unlimitedStorage= permission trigger a user-facing warning in
  Firefox? Evaluate in Phase 6 before AMO submission.
- [ ] What are Open Library's actual rate limit enforcement behaviours for a
  single-user extension? Test live in Phase 3.

** Todos

** Blockers

None.

* Session Continuity

- *Last action* :: [2026-02-26 Thu] -- Planning docs updated to reflect React
  19 + TanStack Query + Storybook + Playwright stack decisions; Phase 1 plans
  revised (01-02 and 01-03 updated); all changes committed
- *Next action* :: Execute Phase 1 -- run plans 01-01, 01-02, 01-03 in order
  (or waves 1 then 2); start with a fresh context window (~~/clear~~)
- *Context for next session* :: Phase 1 is pure setup -- no feature code.
  Focus: ADR infrastructure (01-01, wave 1), Vitest + React + TanStack
  install with jsdom (01-02, wave 1), then five ADRs 0001--0005 (01-03,
  wave 2). ADRs 0006--0010 are written at the start of their respective
  phases, immediately before the relevant implementation. The executor
  should read the plan files and follow them exactly.
