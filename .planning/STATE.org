* Project Reference

- *Core Value* :: Every new tab is a reminder of what you're reading and
  what's next — keeping your reading life visible without leaving the browser.
- *Current Focus* :: Phase 1 -- Tooling & Practice Foundation
- *Stack* :: TypeScript + Vite 7 + =vite-plugin-web-extension= + Vitest +
  XState v5 + ~browser.storage.local~
- *Target* :: Firefox extension (Manifest V3)
- *ADRs* :: =docs/decisions/= (MADR 4.0 structure, org-mode format)

* Accumulated Context

** Architectural decisions (pre-ADR)

- *Storage*: ~browser.storage.local~ only -- never =window.localStorage=
  (wiped on privacy clear)
- *Manifest*: V3 (Firefox 109+) -- no service workers; event pages are fine
- *State management*: XState v5 machines/actors for ALL stateful logic --
  no ad-hoc flags
- *No background script*: architecture is single privileged page (new tab)
  with direct storage access
- *Book metadata API*: Open Library only -- no API key = no key exposure in
  extension source
- *Data structure*: =booktab_data= key →
  ~{ schemaVersion, books: Record<id, BookRecord>, settings }~
- *No UI framework*: Vanilla TypeScript + CSS; Preact is upgrade path if
  justified
- *Documentation*: All docs in org-mode; ADRs follow MADR 4.0 structure in
  =docs/decisions/= as =.org= files

** Critical pitfalls (pre-empt in Phase 2)

1. *CSP blocks inline JS / CDN scripts* -- all handlers via
   ~addEventListener()~, all JS in =.js= files
2. =window.localStorage= *wiped on privacy clear* -- use
   ~browser.storage.local~ exclusively
3. *Async race on new tab open* -- show loading state until
   ~storage.get()~ resolves; gate writes behind =storageReady=
4. *Flat unversioned export schema* -- =schemaVersion: 1= in schema from
   day one; migration layer before any schema change ships
5. *Open Library rate limits* -- 400--600ms debounce, =User-Agent= header,
   both =openlibrary.org= + =covers.openlibrary.org= in =host_permissions=
6. *Destructive import without warning* -- auto-backup before import;
   confirmation dialog; schema validation before write

** Developer practice rules (locked in Phase 1)

- Every phase begins with a tidy-up step (refactoring/cleanup before new
  feature code)
- Every phase plan includes at least one ADR task (written before
  implementation)
- TDD: red-green-refactor vertical slicing -- one test → one implementation
  → repeat
- No tests written in bulk after implementation
- Tests exercise public interfaces only -- no internal mocking, no
  implementation detail testing

** Open questions

- [ ] Does =unlimitedStorage= permission trigger a user-facing warning in
  Firefox? Evaluate in Phase 6 before AMO submission.
- [ ] What are Open Library's actual rate limit enforcement behaviours for a
  single-user extension? Test live in Phase 3.

** Todos

- [ ] Initialize =docs/decisions/= with MADR 4.0 template (org-mode) -- Phase 1
- [ ] Write ADR for Vitest choice -- Phase 1
- [ ] Write ADR for TDD methodology -- Phase 1
- [ ] Write ADR for XState v5 choice -- Phase 2
- [ ] Scaffold extension with =vite-plugin-web-extension= -- Phase 2
- [ ] Lock data schema in =schema.ts= before any feature code -- Phase 2

** Blockers

None.

* Session Continuity

- *Last action* :: Roadmap created [2026-02-25 Tue]
- *Next action* :: =/gsd-plan-phase 1= -- plan Tooling & Practice Foundation
- *Context for next session* :: Phase 1 is pure setup -- no feature code.
  Focus: ADRs for TDD/Vitest, Vitest config, =docs/decisions/= initialization,
  =CONTRIBUTING.org= capturing developer practice rules.
