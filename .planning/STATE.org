* Project Reference

- *Core Value* :: Every new tab is a reminder of what you're reading and
  what's next — keeping your reading life visible without leaving the browser.
- *Current Focus* :: Phase 4 -- New Tab Display (planned, not yet started)
- *Stack* :: TypeScript 5.9.3 + Vite 7.3.1 + =vite-plugin-web-extension= +
  React 19 + ~@xstate/react~ + XState v5 + TanStack Query +
  ~browser.storage.local~ + Vitest browser mode (Playwright/Chromium) +
  =vitest-browser-react= + Storybook + Playwright/Chromium +
  Oxlint + Oxfmt
- *Target* :: React SPA delivered as a Firefox extension (Manifest V3) — the
  extension is a thin shell; the app is a standard React SPA in the new tab page
- *ADRs* :: =docs/decisions/= (MADR 4.0 structure, org-mode format)

* Accumulated Context

** Architectural decisions (pre-ADR)

- *Storage* :: ~browser.storage.local~ only -- never =window.localStorage=
  (wiped on privacy clear)
- *Manifest* :: V3 (Firefox 109+) -- no service workers; event pages are fine
- *UI layer* :: React 19 -- chosen over Vanilla TS because UI complexity spans
  4--6 views, stateful forms, and XState/TanStack Query integration; ADR-0003
  written in Phase 1 before scaffold begins
- *Async storage* :: TanStack Query wraps ~browser.storage.local~ -- provides
  loading/error/success states and cache invalidation via
  ~browser.storage.onChanged~; ADR-0004 written in Phase 1
- *State management* :: XState v5 machines/actors for ALL stateful logic;
  ~@xstate/react~ (~useMachine~, ~useSelector~) bridges to React; ADR-0007
  written in Phase 2 before any machine code
- *No background script* :: architecture is single privileged page (new tab)
  with direct storage access
- *Book metadata API* :: Open Library only -- no API key = no key exposure in
  extension source; ADR-0009 written in Phase 3 before search is implemented
- *Data structure* :: =booktab_data= key →
  ~{ schemaVersion, books: Record<id, BookRecord>, settings }~
- *Component isolation* :: Storybook (Vite builder, React framework) --
  ADR-0005 written in Phase 1; installation in Phase 2 when first component exists
- *E2E testing* :: Playwright / Chromium only -- Playwright cannot load
  extensions in its Firefox build; ADR-0006 written in Phase 2 before E2E scaffold
- *Documentation* :: All docs in org-mode; ADRs follow MADR 4.0 structure in
  =docs/decisions/= as =.org= files

** Critical pitfalls (pre-empt in Phase 2)

1. *CSP blocks inline JS / CDN scripts* -- all handlers via
   ~addEventListener()~, all JS in =.js= files
2. =window.localStorage= *wiped on privacy clear* -- use
   ~browser.storage.local~ exclusively
3. *Async race on new tab open* -- show loading state until
   ~storage.get()~ resolves; TanStack Query handles loading/error/success
   states; gate writes behind =storageReady=
4. *Flat unversioned export schema* -- =schemaVersion: 1= in schema from
   day one; migration layer before any schema change ships
5. *Open Library rate limits* -- 400--600ms debounce, =User-Agent= header,
   both =openlibrary.org= + =covers.openlibrary.org= in =host_permissions=
6. *Destructive import without warning* -- auto-backup before import;
   confirmation dialog; schema validation before write
7. *Playwright + Firefox* -- Playwright cannot load extensions in its Firefox
   build; E2E smoke tests run in Chromium proxy via
   ~chromium.launchPersistentContext()~; manual Firefox acceptance testing
   required
8. *webextension-polyfill crashes in Storybook / non-extension contexts* --
   =webextension-polyfill= detects it is not running inside a browser
   extension and throws at import time ("This script should only be loaded
   in a browser extension"). Storybook renders stories in regular Chromium
   pages, not extension contexts. Fix: alias =webextension-polyfill= to a
   no-op mock via Vite =resolve.alias= in both =.storybook/main.ts=
   (~viteFinal~) and the Storybook project in =vitest.config.ts=. The mock
   lives at =.storybook/webextension-polyfill-mock.ts=. Stories override
   ~queryFn~ in decorators so the mock is never actually called.

** File format conventions

All project documentation is written in org-mode format (=.org= files).

*Exception -- GSD workflow artefacts:* The =.planning/phases/= directory
contains files ending in =-PLAN.md= and =-SUMMARY.md=. These use the ~.md~
extension because the GSD tooling (=gsd-tools.cjs=) hardcodes
~endsWith('-PLAN.md')~ and ~endsWith('-SUMMARY.md')~ when scanning for plans
and summaries. Renaming them to =.org= would break plan discovery, wave
execution, and progress tracking.

These files are GSD tooling artefacts, not project documentation. Their
content uses YAML frontmatter + XML task blocks (the GSD format). Do not
convert them to org-mode.

All other files -- =REQUIREMENTS.org=, =ROADMAP.org=, =STATE.org=,
=PROJECT.org=, =docs/decisions/*.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org= -- are org-mode.

** Developer practice rules (locked in Phase 1)

- Every phase begins with a tidy-up step (refactoring/cleanup before new
  feature code)
- *ADR before implementation, at any phase* -- an ADR is written immediately
  before implementing any architecturally significant decision, at whatever
  phase that decision arises. If a decision is later revised, a new ADR
  is written that supersedes the previous one (old ADR status set to
  "Superseded by NNNN"). The history is never rewritten -- only extended.
  This creates a complete, honest decision log for learning purposes.
- TDD: red-green-refactor vertical slicing -- one test → one implementation
  → repeat
- No tests written in bulk after implementation
- Tests exercise public interfaces only -- no internal mocking, no
  implementation detail testing
- All ADRs include Mermaid diagrams (ob-mermaid syntax, =:file= header
  required) when the decision involves a flow, state transition, dependency
  graph, or data structure
- Branch per wave: work on =phase-NN/wave-W/short-description= branches,
  merge to =main= (=--no-ff=) when each wave is complete; next wave
  branches from the updated =main=

** Open questions

- [ ] Does =unlimitedStorage= permission trigger a user-facing warning in
  Firefox? Evaluate in Phase 6 before AMO submission.
- [ ] What are Open Library's actual rate limit enforcement behaviours for a
  single-user extension? Test live in Phase 3.

** Blockers

None.

* Session Continuity

- *Last action* :: [2026-02-26 Thu] -- Phase 4 complete: 4 plans executed across
  2 waves. Dashboard layout implemented with CurrentlyReading hero component,
  EmptyHero empty state, QueueCount badge. App.tsx refactored from flat list to
  structured dashboard. Storybook stories for all new components and App dashboard
  states. Playwright E2E tests for hero display, empty state, and queue count.
  100 tests passing (46 unit + 35 browser + 19 storybook + 4 E2E).
- *Next action* :: Plan and execute Phase 5 (Queue).
- *Context for next session* :: Phase 4 is complete on =main=. The new tab page
  now shows a dashboard: currently-reading book in a hero section, empty state
  prompt when nothing is being read, and a queue count badge. All CRUD from
  Phase 3 still works. Phase 5 (Queue) adds a dedicated queue view and intention
  notes. Plans for Phase 5 need to be created.
